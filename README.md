# Result-Automation
Result automation done using selenium python.
This is a selenium project to automate the downloading of results. In this i have used pandas library to import and work with the dataframe. The raw data is cleaned
and preprocessed in jupyter notebook and then used in this project.
The user has to enter the students phone number and then a chrome browser will run to download the result.
For frontend i have used Streamlit framework of python.
